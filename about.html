                The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                River
                in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of
                the
                festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music
                and
                dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An
                account
                from
                1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in
                the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever
                such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville,
                a
                rich
                plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.

                In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe
                Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe
                of
                Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New
                Orleans
                had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade
                that
                the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent,
                Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized'
                the
                Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them
                construct a
                more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to
                American
                just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the
                ballrooms and
                on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor
                entirely
                American."

                In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations,
                including Mardi
                Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion,
                gender or
                sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was
                passed,
                the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the
                long-standing
                traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the
                city
                claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists—the
                19th-century krewes
                Comus and Momus stopped parading.[6] Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also
                suspended its
                parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

                The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                Twelfth
                Night or
                Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.
                <br><br>
                Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                Carnival
                clubs,
                called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors
                quickly
                learn to
                say, "Throw me something mister!"

                The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid &

                and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
                fun-filled
                day
                of
                excitement for revelers of all ages.
                <br><br>
                New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to be
                at
                any
